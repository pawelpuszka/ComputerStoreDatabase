## About
    
  It is a project of stationary and online store which sells computer hardware. 

  The main goals of this project are:

  1. Learn how to design a database.
  2. Learn how to code and solve problems in Oracle database environment using PL/SQL.
  3. Use it to get hired as a developer.

### Built with
    
  Oracle is technology used to design, populate and deploy main features.
    
  Tools:

  * PL/SQL
  * SQL
  * Java
  * Data Modeler
  * SQL Developer
## Designing database

  I've spent a lot of time to design this database according to rules. In most cases it meets requirements of the third normal form.

  It contains data, dictionary and linking tables, moreover there are defined relations between tables to keep consistency and integrity of data. 

  Whole structure is designed to make sure there is possibility to deploy business processes and information flow.

  Link to [database schema](https://pawelpuszka.github.io).

## Populating database

  First step was to prepare .csv files with data for tables:
  * Addresses
  * Employees
  * Products
  * Transactions
  * Clients
  
  In this case `Java` with `Jsoup` was very helpful to get some data from random websites.
  
  Then I had to generate other
